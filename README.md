# CyanNyan's Personal Website Clone

<!-- what  -->

This project is a clone of [CyanNyan](https://github.com/CyanNyan)'s
personal web, but i create it from scratch with zero dependencies.
actually not zero because i use font-awesome, but it just font let's
doesn't count it. The content is still same, i just do a little style
and script modification.

<!-- why  -->

CyanNyan has made a great website, i like her website(and love it).
But there is one problem. The website is just do simple thing but load
tons of uneccessary library that are not needed.

<!-- how -->

Of course, recreate everything from scratch fix it(need a lot of hard
work ~~and love~~).
